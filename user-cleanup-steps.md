# Steps for Project Knowledge Update

## 1. Add New Artifacts
Add these files from our conversation to your project knowledge:
- team-bio.tsx
- team-stats.tsx
- team-error-boundary.tsx
- team-loading.tsx
- handoff-checklist.md
- cleanup-guide.md

## 2. Archive Redundant Files
Move these files to an archive folder:
- Any older versions of team-container.tsx
- Duplicate style definitions
- Multiple versions of background implementations
- Redundant animation systems

## 3. Update Project Knowledge
Simply add a note at the top of your project knowledge indicating:
"Project Knowledge last updated: [date]
Latest components added: Team section components
Next section to implement: Links section"

That's all you need to do! The next Claude will handle:
- File consolidation
- Import path updates
- Creating clean versions of components
- Generating the final package

Just make sure the project knowledge contains the new artifacts listed above, and you can proceed with the next conversation with a fresh Claude instance.
